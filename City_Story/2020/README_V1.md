# My 2020 City Story experience

This directory contains my City Story pictures from all of 2020.

I started playing again on October 29th 2020. I started fresh this time, going from level 1 to level 6, with a population of 1280, city size of 10x10, and an unknown happiness level. have played multiple times in the past, but didn't get very far. This is the first recorded instance of me playing it.

I played on a weekly basis every Thursday from October 29th 2020 to December 31st 2020.

This year, I went from level 1 to level 10, with a population of 2960, a city size of xxXxx (data needed) and an unknown happiness level (data needed)

## Some notes

1. The first pictures are in `2560x1440` quality up to November 19th 2020. On November 19th 2020, it was the first time playing on a new phone with higher specs, but lower screen resolution, so pictures from this point onward are in `2400x1080` resolution

2. City story is an online game

3. This game is targeted towards children, but can be used as an all ages game

4. I created this `README` file 3 months late, as I am experimenting with creating monthly and yearly `README.md` files for all the games I play. I am starting this experiment with City Story and Lego Tower.

5. I am playing the game on a weekly schedule, every Thursday. I do not play at all on other days of the week.

6. No other notes for this month
