# My November 2020 City Story experience

This directory contains my City Story pictures from all of November 2020.

November 2020 is the second consecutive month that I played this game. I have played multiple times in the past, but didn't get very far. This is the first recorded instance of me playing it.

I started playing again on October 29th 2020. I started fresh this time, going from level 1 to level 6, with a population of 1280, city size of 10x10, and an unknown happiness level.

This month, I went from level 6 to level 9, with a population of 1920, a city size of xxXxx (data needed) and an unknown happiness level (data needed)

## Some notes

1. Pictures for this month are in `2560x1440` quality up to November 18th 2020. On November 19th 2020, it was the first time playing on a new phone with higher specs, but lower screen resolution, so pictures from this point onward are in `2400x1080` resolution

2. City story is an online game

3. This game is targeted towards children, but can be used as an all ages game

4. I created this `README` file 4 months late, as I am experimenting with creating monthly `README.md` files for all the games I play. I am starting this experiment with City Story and Lego Tower.

5. I am playing the game on a weekly schedule, every Thursday. I do not play at all on other days of the week.

6. No other notes for this month
